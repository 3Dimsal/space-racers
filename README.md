This project is a Fullstack MERN Application using Redux for state management. Space Racers allows you to post a picture and description of your favorite cruiser to the main feed to view with other cruisers that are posted to the MongoDB databse. I used Three.js and react-three-fiber to create a 3d visualization of a cruiser circling earth as well.
